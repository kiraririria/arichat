### 🟥CLOSED SOURCE🟥
Currently, **Arichat** consists of 3 projects
Arichat for version 1.12.2 and 1.20.4
**Arichat Classic** for 1.12.2, which does not have automation, but will be presented as an independent frontend (analogous to SillyTavern) together with MsHorse's mods.
This makes it an advantage for AI streams and maps in Minecraft.
This repository will contain tutorials, materials, progress boards for further development.
